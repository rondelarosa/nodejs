Why to use socket.io?
    - to get data in a specified time like in a second which called term pulling
    - socket.io is websocket library which we can notify client
    - push notification to client or multiple clients and this works the same way
    - default to pulling for older browser not supporting websocket

Which code should come instead of the ??? placeholder to start the server-side Socket.io functionality? http.listen


socket.io
    - bidirectional communication
    - has two points: client side library runs on browser and server side library runs on nodejs
